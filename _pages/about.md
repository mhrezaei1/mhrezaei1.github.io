I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [**University of Arizona**](https://www.arizona.edu/) <img src="assets/img/uofa.png" alt="UArizona" height="20px"/> majoring in [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/).
I am a member of the [**Computational Language Understanding (CLU) Lab**](https://clulab.org/) <img src="assets/img/clulab.png" alt="CLU lab" height="20px"/> advised by [Dr. Eduardo Blanco](https://eduardoblanco.github.io/).
Previously, I was a research intern at [**Stanford University**](https://www.stanford.edu/) <img src="assets/img/stanford.png" alt="Stanford" height="20px"/> advised by [Dr. Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) in the [**SALT Lab**](https://saltlab.stanford.edu/) <img src="assets/img/salt_logo.svg" alt="SALT" height="20px"/>. 
I am also a part of the [**Open Social World**](https://opensocial.world) <img src="assets/img/osw.png" alt="OSW" height="20px"/> group. I have worked on various projects in natural language processing and machine learning
such as [negation understanding](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.55/),  [multilingual QA](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.146/), and [physical social norm understanding](https://egonormia.org). 
This summer, I am a post-training research intern at [**Scale AI**](https://scale.com/) <img src="assets/img/scale_logo.jpg" alt="Scale AI" height="20px"/>. 
<!-- Currently, I am working on projects related to commonsense reasoning and natural language understanding. -->


Outside research, I am a [Course Coordinator (Head TA)](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/ugta) for the CSc 144: Discrete Math for CS I course offered by the computer science department. I also serve as a [Peer Mentor](https://cs.arizona.edu/about/cs-buddy-mentor-program) and a [CS Ambassador](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/cs-ambassador-program-csa) for the department to help incoming students and promote computer science education. I am honored to have been awarded the [Iranian Scholarship Foundation (ISF)](https://theisf.org/) undergraduate scholarship. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, listening to music, and hiking.
