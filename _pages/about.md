I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [**University of Arizona**](https://www.arizona.edu/)<img src="assets/img/uofa.png" alt="UArizona" height="20px"/> majoring in [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/).
I am a member of the [**Computational Language Understanding Lab**](https://clulab.org/)<img src="assets/img/clulab.png" alt="CLU lab" height="20px"/> currently advised by [Dr. Eduardo Blanco](https://eduardoblanco.github.io/).
Previously, I was a research intern at [**Stanford University**](https://www.stanford.edu/)<img src="assets/img/stanford.png" alt="Stanford" height="20px"/> advised by [Dr. Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) in the [SALT Lab](https://saltlab.stanford.edu/)<img src="assets/img/salt_logo.svg" alt="SALT" height="20px"/>. 
I have worked on various projects in natural language processing and machine learning
such as [negation understanding](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.55/), [multilingual QA](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.146/), and am currently working on social norms understanding and generalization in language models.

Outside research, I am a Course Coordinator (Head TA) for the [CSc 144: Discrete Math for CS I]() course offered by the computer science department. I also serve as a Peer Mentor and a CS Ambassador for the department to help incoming students and promote computer science education. I am honored to have been awarded the [Iranian Scholarship Foundation (ISF)](https://theisf.org/) undergraduate scholarship. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, listening to music, and hiking.
