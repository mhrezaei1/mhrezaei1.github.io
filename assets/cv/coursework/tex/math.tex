    \item \texttt{Summary of Topics:} Elementary real analysis as an introduction to abstract mathematics and the use
    of mathematical language. Elementary logic and quantifiers; manipulations with sets, relations and
    functions, including images and pre-images; properties of the real numbers; supreme and infimum;
    other topics selected from cardinality, the topology of the real line, sequence and limits of sequences
    and functions; the emphasis throughout is on proving theorems.
